# Assignment 3 Idata2305

## Aleksanders contribution:

Made first come first serve cpu scheduling algorithm.

Learn more about cpu scheduling and how the timing works for scheduling. Specifically for first come first serve one sees that arrival time, as in the name means who gets server first, i learned about the various times like burst time(time spent until a process is done by the cpu), waiting time(time that an arrived process waits before it gets cpu time, arrival time(when a process arrived in the queue) and turnaround time which is the total time taken from arrival to being processed. Lastly, completion time, which is the time that a process finishes.

## Danielâ€™s Contrubution:

Made the Process Class and the PreemptivePriorityScheduler Class.

This project allowed me to learn about the information needed to run a Process in a Preemptive Priority System. Because of the focus on the Priority system I learned how a dynamic scheduler can help in allowing important tasks first instead of making them wait for 20 other things first. It also allowed me to gain practical experience with real time scheduling logic.
